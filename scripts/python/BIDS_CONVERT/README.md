This code is meant to help with the creation of BIDS imaging data in Python. We've found HEUDICONV can be difficult to implement, so this is meant to be a more user-friendly option.

Example instantiation.
> DICOM_TO_BIDS.py --dataset RAW/ --datefile DICOM_DATES.csv --datalake HUP_BIDS_DATALAKE.pickle --bidsroot ./BIDSROOT/ --subject 0

would convert all the NIFTII data within the 'RAW' directory to BIDS format. The output directory is './BIDSROOT', and it creates a file called 'DICOM_DATES.csv' to remember each session name for a given subject on a given date. In this case, 
subject '0'.

For more help, type:

> DICOM_TO_BIDS.py --help

You will need nibable and pybids to run this package.
